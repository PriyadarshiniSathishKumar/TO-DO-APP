# TO-DO-APP
This to-do app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks while tracking their completion status. The app stores tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist across sessions. The user interface includes a progress bar and a counter displaying the number of completed tasks out of the total.

# HTML Code 
The HTML structure of this to-do app is straightforward and focused on functionality. It starts with a <head> section that includes meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings to ensure responsiveness across devices. The CSS is linked externally to style the app, and the JavaScript files are included to handle the app's interactive features. The body contains a container that houses the to-do list's main components: a title, motivational text, and a progress bar to visually track task completion. Below this, there's an input field for adding new tasks and a button to submit them. A list element is used to dynamically display tasks as they are added, providing a user-friendly interface.

# CSS Code 
The CSS defines the visual styling of the app, using CSS variables for consistent theming across different components. The app’s design is centered, with a modern look achieved through a dark background, contrasting text, and vibrant colors for interactive elements. Flexbox is used to layout the app’s components, ensuring they are well-spaced and responsive. The progress bar, buttons, and task items are styled with rounded corners and subtle animations to enhance the user experience. The use of a consistent color palette, with shades of purple and teal, provides a cohesive and visually appealing design.

# JavaScript Code 
The JavaScript handles the app's core functionality, including task management and storage. Upon loading, it retrieves any previously saved tasks from local storage and displays them. Users can add new tasks, which are saved to the array and local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions. The script also includes functionality to toggle task completion, edit tasks, and delete them, with each action updating the display and storage accordingly. The progress bar dynamically adjusts based on the number of completed tasks, and once all tasks are completed, a confetti effect is triggered using the tsParticles library. This confetti animation adds an interactive and celebratory element to the app, making task completion more engaging for users.
